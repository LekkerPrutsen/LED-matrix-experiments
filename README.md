## What you need ##
- Raspberry Pi
- MAX7219 LED 4 in 1 Matrix Display. Available at [AliExpress](https://nl.aliexpress.com/item/MAX7219-Microcontroller-4-In-1-Display-with-5P-Line-Dot-Matrix-Module-for-Arduino/32669747663.html?spm=2114.13010608.0.0.gZJlAA&detailNewVersion=&categoryId=200003315)


## Pre-requisites ##
**Step 1**: enable the SPI driver kernel. See [instructions](https://github.com/rm-hull/max7219/blob/master/docs/install.rst) from @rm-hull

**Step 2**: install the library. See [instructions](https://github.com/rm-hull/max7219/blob/master/docs/install.rst) from @rm-hull

**Step 3**: Connnect the LED matrix to your Raspberry Pi. See [instructions](https://github.com/rm-hull/max7219/blob/master/docs/install.rst) from @rm-hull

## Experiment 1: identify the devices (1)
The MAX7219 4 in 1 LED matrix is composed of four elements. We want to identify the devices.


## Experiment 2: indentify the devices (2)
Same as experiment 1. But now with clearing the numbers after showing them for 1 second. 


## Experiment 3: identify the devices (3)
Same as experiment 2. But now horizontal.


## Experiment 4: identify the devices (4)
Same as experiment 3. But now with loop. 

## Experiment 5: identify the devices (5)
Same as experiment 4. But now random.

## Experiment 6: Knight Rider (1)
Knight Rider LED scanner

## Experiment 7: Knight Rider (2)
Same as Experiment 6. Used other symbols.
